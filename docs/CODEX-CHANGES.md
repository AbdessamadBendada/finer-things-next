# Codex change log

This is the durable handoff log for AI-authored work in this repository. Read
the newest entry before starting. Keep entries concise, factual and newest
first. Git remains the source of truth for exact diffs.

## How to record a change

Every completed AI task must add an entry with this structure:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD: Short task name

**Codex change**

- Commit: `<hash and subject>`, `uncommitted`, or `this commit` when the entry
  records the commit that creates it
- Changed: what changed and why
- Files: the important paths
- Verified: checks that actually ran and their result
- Follow-up: remaining work, or `None`
```

Do not record personal data, secrets, speculative work or a copy of the full
Git diff. If a change updates an architectural rule, security posture or open
decision, update its authoritative document too and link it from the entry.

## 2026-09-01: Replace considered objects wording

**Codex change**

- Commit: `this commit`
- Changed: replaced every occurrence of “considered objects” with “distinctive
  designs” across the live site and matching legacy reference copy.
- Files: `src/features/about/ui/AboutPage.tsx`,
  `src/features/contact/ui/ContactPage.tsx`,
  `src/features/home/ui/HomePage.tsx`, `legacy/contact.html`,
  `legacy/index.html`, `docs/CODEX-CHANGES.md`
- Verified: repository-wide case-insensitive search found no remaining exact
  phrase; typecheck, lint, production build and all 8 form tests passed; all 9
  Home, About and Contact parity checks passed. The full parity rerun was
  interrupted by the test server exiting and then by an OS memory kill.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-08-31: Harden mobile launch behavior without redesigning pages

**Codex change**

- Commit: `this commit`
- Changed: expanded the burger and logo hit areas without moving the masthead;
  added safe-area and short-landscape handling; reduced Home's initial image
  competition; warmed clipped service imagery before reveal; and added focused
  mobile regression coverage. Layout-changing content-control and typography
  proposals were reverted after parity identified their impact.
- Files: `src/shared/styles/brand.css`, `src/shared/styles/chrome.css`,
  `src/features/home/`, relevant short-landscape feature styles,
  `tests/visual/mobile-readiness.spec.ts`,
  `docs/MOBILE-LAUNCH-ACTION-PLAN.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- Verified: `pnpm verify` passed (typecheck, lint, production build, 8 form
  tests and 36 visual-parity checks); 40 masthead checks and 5 focused
  mobile-readiness checks also passed.
- Follow-up: verify Contact focus behavior and notch/home-indicator clearance
  on physical iPhone and Android devices; measure deployed mobile LCP; obtain
  design approval before changing page-content target sizes or small text.

## 2026-08-31: Add mobile and SEO launch action plans

**Codex change**

- Commit: `this commit`
- Changed: documented the measured mobile audit and the production-rendered
  SEO audit as two prioritized, acceptance-testable launch work queues.
- Files: `docs/MOBILE-LAUNCH-ACTION-PLAN.md`,
  `docs/SEO-LAUNCH-ACTION-PLAN.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`,
  `docs/CODEX-CHANGES.md`
- Verified: audited 13 production-rendered routes across four responsive
  viewports; checked Googlebot metadata, headings, links, images, JSON-LD,
  robots, sitemap, Open Graph output, redirects and 404 behavior; ran the
  production build; checked Markdown formatting and Git whitespace.
- Follow-up: implement the P0 and P1 tasks in the two action plans before
  launch.

## 2026-08-31: Add the Codex handoff log

**Codex change**

- Commit: `this commit`
- Changed: added this append-only AI change log and made it required reading
  and writing in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
- Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/CODEX-CHANGES.md`
- Verified: Markdown formatting and repository diff checks.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-08-31: Use supplied photography in the gallery

**Codex change**

- Commit: `7f96e9b Gallery: use the supplied project photography`
- Changed: replaced the gallery wall's older imagery with 20 supplied client
  photographs and updated the image descriptions, credits and alt text.
- Files: `src/features/project-new/content/wall.content.ts`
- Verified: `pnpm verify` passed, including 8 form tests and 36 visual parity
  checks.
- Follow-up: two supplied images remain deliberately unused because one is a
  phone snapshot and the other duplicates an existing angle.
