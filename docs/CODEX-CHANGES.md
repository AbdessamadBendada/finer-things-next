# Codex change log

This is the durable handoff log for AI-authored work in this repository. Read
the newest entry before starting. Keep entries concise, factual and newest
first. Git remains the source of truth for exact diffs.

## How to record a change

Every completed AI task must add an entry with this structure:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD: Short task name

**Codex change**

- Commit: `<hash and subject>`, `uncommitted`, or `this commit` when the entry
  records the commit that creates it
- Changed: what changed and why
- Files: the important paths
- Verified: checks that actually ran and their result
- Follow-up: remaining work, or `None`
```

Do not record personal data, secrets, speculative work or a copy of the full
Git diff. If a change updates an architectural rule, security posture or open
decision, update its authoritative document too and link it from the entry.

## 2026-08-31: Add the Codex handoff log

**Codex change**

- Commit: `this commit`
- Changed: added this append-only AI change log and made it required reading
  and writing in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
- Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/CODEX-CHANGES.md`
- Verified: Markdown formatting and repository diff checks.
- Follow-up: None.

## 2026-08-31: Use supplied photography in the gallery

**Codex change**

- Commit: `7f96e9b Gallery: use the supplied project photography`
- Changed: replaced the gallery wall's older imagery with 20 supplied client
  photographs and updated the image descriptions, credits and alt text.
- Files: `src/features/project-new/content/wall.content.ts`
- Verified: `pnpm verify` passed, including 8 form tests and 36 visual parity
  checks.
- Follow-up: two supplied images remain deliberately unused because one is a
  phone snapshot and the other duplicates an existing angle.
